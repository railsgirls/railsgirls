      <h3>Rails for Girls Workshop in Helsinki Nov 26-27th, 2010</h3>

      <p>Rails for Girls is a 12-hour Ruby-on-Rails workshop for absolute
      beginners in the world of programming and web development organized by the
      Helsinki-based software development firm Kisko Labs.
      </p>

      <p>The weekend event is free and open to all enthusiastic girls and women.
      Rails for Girls wants to empower girls to build the capacity and acquire
      the tools to conquer the last online frontier.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Karri Saarinen</strong>, partner at Kisko Labs explains:</p>

      <p><em>- The Internet was built by and for boys. As a girl, one often
      feels like lacking the vocabulary to access it. With Rails for Girls, we
      want to demystify the world of web applications and encourage women to
      learn about software development and programming. We believe that women
      need the skills and language to understand that world.</em></p>
    
      <p>Kisko Labs, the software consultancy behind Rails for Girls has noticed
      that female technologists have power and potential.</p>

      <p><strong>Antti Akonniemi</strong>, CEO of Kisko Labs points out:</p>
      <p><em>- Building software services and micro applications is cheaper,
      faster and easier than ever before yet women's visions are
      underrepresented.</em></p>

      <p>The weekend will be hosted at Kisko Labs' premises in Kamppi, Helsinki.
      About 100 web enthusiasts have showed interest in the first ever Rails for
      Girls workshop.</p> 

      <p><em>- The workshop is also a networking opportunity. But above all it
      will be a fun and unique experience</em>, continues Antti.</p>

      <p>The materials for the workshop will be published on the Rails for Girls
      website, hoping to encourage others to replicate the workshop concept.</p>
