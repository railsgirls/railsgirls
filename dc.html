        Here in DC, we're about more than just politics and monuments, we have a strong technology community that loves Ruby and Rails. Rails Girls DC hosts 2-day workshops to introduce women to Ruby, Rails and the local programming community.

       <br>
       <br>
      </p>

    <p>
      Our workshop will once again be run alongside <a href="http://www.rubynation.org">RubyNation</a>. <!--We are thrilled that <a href='http://railsgirls.com/press'>Linda Liukas</a>, (co-creator of Rails Girls) is a part of this year's lineup!-->
      </p>
    </p>

<!--      <h2> Rails Girls Next </h2>
      <p>
        Rails Girls Next is a day-long unconference that provides women the chance to talk about the topics they care about most in a comfortable setting. Participants decide on the discussion topics at the beginning of the day together. Topics will be both technical and non-technical and will be discussed in small groups (no more than ~30 women in a group). All levels are welcome and you will also have an opportunity to meet with Rails Girls Workshop participants. More information on unconferences can be found <a href =" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You don't have to be a Rails Girls workshop alum to attend. If you are looking to get into developing for the first time, we encourage you to apply to the Rails Girls DC Workshop.
</p>

      <p> Applications have been extended until April 29th, 2016:
        <br>
