  <h2>Our full policy</h2>

  <p>
    Rails Girls Munich is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone attending our workshops, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Any participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the workshop at the discretion of the workshop organizers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination (related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or socio-economic background); sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Participants include: attendees, coaches, sponsors, organisers, and everyone else involved in or helping with running the event as well as guests and visitors to the event.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Presenters and sponsors of the workshop are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, presenters and sponsors should not use sexualized images or content in any presentations or promotional materials.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns</strong>, please contact one of the organizers immediately.
    At the event, participants will be informed which team members in particular to contact in the case of an incident, and how to contact them directly.
  </p>

  <p>
    We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.
