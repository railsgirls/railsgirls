<!--   How to change the picture & header for site
In the assets folder there is something called rg-header.psd. Be sure to download the fonts also. Name the file rg-yourcityname-header.png and your city picture rg-yourcityname.png. Add them to /images. 

Steps to show on site
1. Go to style.css
2. Add these lines, always replacing 'yourcityname' with your actual city name. 

        .yourcityname#promo {
          padding-left:340px;
          background:url('../images/rg-yourcityname.png') no-repeat 0 10px,
                         url('../images/separator.png') no-repeat center bottom;
        }

        It will take a while before the changes show, so don't panic!

        <a href="http://freshly-picked.com/">Freshly Picked</a> aka Susan Petersen started making baby moccasins in 2009 after becoming frustrated by the lack of well-designed baby shoes. Working at her kitchen table, on a shoestring budget, Susan persisted through some disastrous attempts until she had created a pair of moccasins that not only looked adorable on her little Gus&#8217; chubby feet, but stayed on his feet as well. Since then Susan has created a mini-empire that works to not only keep the cutest shoes on kids&#8217; feet, but also to empower and inspire women.
